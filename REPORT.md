# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

## Overview

In this project, two reinforcement learning (RL) agents were trained to play tennis against each other. For this project, you will work with the [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment. This project environment is similar to, but not identical to the [Tennis environment](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md) on the Unity ML-Agents GitHub page.

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of **+0.1**.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of **-0.01**.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of **8** variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. **2** continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping. 

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of **+0.5** (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least **+0.5**.

## Learning Algorithm

### Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG)
This project implements an off-policy method called **Multi Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient**. For the single agent DDPG, the details can be found in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf), written by researchers at Google Deepmind. The DDPG algorithm belongs to the actor-critic methods, that use deep function approximators to learn policies in high-dimensional, continuous action spaces. From the single agent DDPG, we can make modifications to apply it to multiple competitive agents simultaneously in the Tennis environment. If you are interested in MADDPG, the details are in [this paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/68a9750337a418a86fe06c1991a1d64c-Paper.pdf).

The implementation details of MADDPG can be found in the **maddpg_agent.py** file in this repository.

### Actor-Critic Method
Actor-critic methods leverage the strengths of both policy-based and value-based methods. Using a policy-based approach, the agent (actor) learns how to act by directly estimating the optimal policy and maximizing reward through gradient ascent. Meanwhile, employing a value-based approach, the agent (critic) learns how to estimate the value (i.e., the future cumulative reward) of different state-action pairs. Actor-critic methods combine these two approaches in order to accelerate the learning process. Actor-critic agents are also more stable than value-based agents, while requiring fewer training samples than policy-based agents.

The implementation details can be found in the **model.py** file in this repository.

### Hyperparameters

The MADDPG used the following hyperparameters (details in maddpg_agent.py)

```
BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e6)  # replay buffer size
BATCH_SIZE = 128        # minibatch size
GAMMA = 0.99            # discount factor
TAU = 7e-2              # for soft update of target parameters
LR_ACTOR = 1e-3         # learning rate of the actor
LR_CRITIC = 1e-3        # learning rate of the critic
WEIGHT_DECAY = 0        # L2 weight decay
LEARN_EVERY = 5         # learning timestep interval
LEARN_NUM = 5           # number of learning passes
OU_SIGMA = 0.2          # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter, volatility
OU_THETA = 0.12         # Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise parameter, speed of mean reversion
EPS_START = 5.5         # initial value for epsilon in noise decay process in Agent.act()
EPS_EP_END = 250        # episode to end the noise decay process
EPS_FINAL = 0           # final value for epsilon after decay
```

### Model Architecture

The model architecture is as follows (details in model.py):

For the actor part, it consists of 3 fully connnected layers:
```
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size*2, fc1_units)
self.fc2 = nn.Linear(fc1_units, fc2_units)
self.fc3 = nn.Linear(fc2_units, action_size)
```

For the critic part, it consists of 3 fully connnected layers:
```
self.fcs1 = nn.Linear(state_size*2, fcs1_units)
self.fc2 = nn.Linear(fcs1_units+(action_size*2), fc2_units)
self.fc3 = nn.Linear(fc2_units, 1)
```

The Actor received 8 variables (observation space) from each agent as input and generated 2 numbers (predicted action) as output. The first two fully connected layers were followed by ReLU activation function while the third fully connected layers were followed by tanh activation function to output vector between -1 and 1. The Actor is used to approximate the optimal policy Ï€ deterministically.

The Critic received 8 variables (observation space) from each agent as input, and its first hidden layer was stacked with the Actor's output layer as the Critic's second hidden layer. Eventually giving predictions on the target value, the optimal action-value function Q(s,a), by using the Actor's best-believed action.

The visualization of the model architecture is as follows:

The networks used the Adam optimizer, and the learning rate was set to 0.001, with a batch size of 128.

### Plot of Rewards

![Rewards](./images/Scores.png)

This tennis environment was solved in **745** episodes, the average score from 745 to 844 is **0.538**, which meets the requirement that the average (over 100 episodes) of the scores from two agents is at least +0.5. The final model weights are saved in **checkpoint_actor_0.pth** and **checkpoint_critic_0.pth** for the first agent and **checkpoint_actor_1.pth** and **checkpoint_critic_1.pth** for the second agent.

## Ideas for Future Work

To improve the performance of the agent(s), there are several ideas to tune the MADDPG algorithm we have used:
- Through **trial and error** and test out other combinations of the hyperparameters, there might be other sets of values that could solve the environment faster.
- The MADDPG used minibatches taken uniformly from the replay buffer. We can test out the **prioritized replay buffer** and compare the results.
- The MADDPG used the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise to solve the environment. We can test out **other noise process algorithms** and compare the results.
- The requirement of the task was set to a score of +0.5 over 100 consecutive episodes. With a **higher target score**, the agents might do better.

There are also other actor-critic methods available for us to explore, such as [Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) alorithm](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/td3.html). We can run this project on alternative algorithms and compare the results.
